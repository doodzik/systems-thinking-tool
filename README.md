**Core Components:**
- `DSLEditor`: Monaco editor with custom syntax highlighting
- `SystemDiagram`: React Flow with proper stock/flow/cloud nodes
- `SystemGraph`: Real-time Recharts with table toggle
- `SimulationControls`: Working step/run/pause controls
- `DSLParser`: Converts text DSL to executable SystemModel

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## How to Use

1. **Edit the DSL:** Use the Monaco editor on the left to modify your system dynamics model
2. **Watch the Diagram:** The visual diagram updates automatically as you edit
3. **Run Simulation:** Use controls to step through or continuously run the simulation
4. **View Graphs:** Track system behavior over time with real-time charts

## DSL Reference

The Systems Thinking Tool uses a simple, readable DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to define system dynamics models. This allows you to describe complex systems in plain text without writing code.

### Quick Example

Here's a simple population growth model:

```
stock Population {
  initial: 100
  units: "people"
}

flow Births {
  from: source
  to: Population
  rate: Population * 0.02
}
```

This creates a population that grows at 2% per time step. The diagram automatically shows a cloud (infinite source), a flow valve, and a stock rectangle.

### Core Constructs

#### Stocks

Stocks represent accumulations in your system - things that build up or deplete over time.

**Syntax:**
```
stock StockName {
  initial: number     // Starting value (required)
  units: "string"     // Unit of measurement (optional)
  min: number         // Minimum constraint (optional)
  max: number         // Maximum constraint (optional)
}
```

**Examples:**
```
stock BankAccount {
  initial: 1000
  min: 0
  units: "dollars"
}

stock Temperature {
  initial: 72
  min: 32
  max: 212
  units: "°F"
}
```

#### Flows

Flows represent rates of change - how stocks increase or decrease over time.

**Syntax:**
```
flow FlowName {
  from: StockName | source | sink
  to: StockName | source | sink
  rate: expression
  units: "string"     // Optional
}
```

**Special keywords:**
- `source` - Infinite supply (shown as a cloud)
- `sink` - Infinite drain (shown as a cloud)

**Examples:**
```
// Simple constant rate
flow Rainfall {
  from: source
  to: Reservoir
  rate: 10
}

// Dynamic rate based on stock value
flow Evaporation {
  from: Reservoir
  to: sink
  rate: Reservoir * 0.05
}

// Complex expression
flow NetIncome {
  from: source
  to: BankAccount
  rate: Salary - Expenses
  units: "dollars/month"
}
```

#### Constants

Define reusable values at the top of your model.

**Syntax:**
```
const ConstantName = value
```

**Examples:**
```
const GrowthRate = 0.05
const MaxCapacity = 1000
const TargetTemperature = 70
```

Constants can be used in any rate expression and can reference other constants:
```
const BaseRate = 10
const AdjustedRate = BaseRate * 1.5
```

### Rate Expressions

Rate expressions can use standard mathematical operators and functions:

#### Operators

- **Arithmetic:** `+` `-` `*` `/` `%`
- **Comparison:** `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `==` `!=`
- **Logical:** `&&` `||` `!`
- **Conditional:** `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`

**Examples:**
```
rate: Population * 0.02
rate: (Income - Expenses) / 12
rate: Temperature > 100 ? CoolingRate : 0
rate: Stock1 > Stock2 && Stock1 < 100 ? 5 : 0
```

#### Mathematical Functions

All standard JavaScript Math functions are available:

- **Basic:** `sqrt(x)`, `abs(x)`, `pow(base, exp)`
- **Rounding:** `floor(x)`, `ceil(x)`, `round(x)`
- **Min/Max:** `min(a, b, ...)`, `max(a, b, ...)`
- **Exponential:** `exp(x)`, `log(x)`
- **Trigonometric:** `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`

**Examples:**
```
rate: sqrt(Population)
rate: max(0, Temperature - TargetTemp) * CoolingRate
rate: min(MaxCapacity - Stock, DesiredFlow)
```

#### Built-in Constants

- `TIME` - Current simulation time
- `dt` - Time step size (default: 1)
- `PI` - π (3.14159...)
- `E` - e (2.71828...)

**Examples:**
```
rate: 100 * sin(TIME * PI / 12)  // Oscillating pattern
rate: InitialValue * exp(GrowthRate * TIME)
```

### Delay Functions

Delays model time lags and inertia in systems - critical for realistic behavior.

#### SMOOTH(input, time)

Exponential smoothing creates a moving average that gradually adapts to changes.

**When to use:** Information delays, perception lags, gradual adjustments

**Example:**
```
const AdjustmentTime = 5

flow AdjustProduction {
  from: source
  to: Inventory
  rate: SMOOTH(Demand, AdjustmentTime)
}
```

This smooths demand fluctuations, so production adjusts gradually rather than instantly.

#### DELAY(input, time)

Pipeline delay - what goes in now comes out exactly N time units later.

**When to use:** Shipping delays, manufacturing pipelines, maturation processes

**Example:**
```
const ShippingTime = 7

flow Deliveries {
  from: OnOrder
  to: Inventory
  rate: DELAY(Orders, ShippingTime)
}
```

Orders placed today arrive exactly 7 time units later.

#### DELAY_GRADUAL(input, time)

Smooth material delay with natural variation (third-order delay).

**When to use:** Processes with natural variability, biological systems, distributed delays

**Example:**
```
const RecoveryTime = 14

flow Recoveries {
  from: Sick
  to: Healthy
  rate: DELAY_GRADUAL(Infections, RecoveryTime)
}
```

People recover over a range of times around 14 days, not all exactly at day 14.

### Lookup Tables

Lookup tables define nonlinear relationships based on data or empirical observations.

#### 1D Lookup Tables

**Syntax:**
```
lookup TableName {
  [x1, y1]
  [x2, y2]
  [x3, y3]
}
```

The tool automatically interpolates between points using linear interpolation.

**Example: Productivity vs. Experience**
```
lookup ProductivityCurve {
  [0, 0.3]      // New employee: 30% productive
  [1, 0.6]      // 1 year: 60% productive
  [3, 0.9]      // 3 years: 90% productive
  [5, 1.0]      // 5+ years: 100% productive
}

flow Work {
  from: source
  to: Output
  rate: Employees * LOOKUP(AverageExperience, ProductivityCurve)
}
```

#### 2D Lookup Tables

For relationships depending on two variables.

**Syntax:**
```
lookup2d TableName {
  [x1, y1]: z1
  [x2, y2]: z2
}
```

**Example: Engine Efficiency**
```
lookup2d EngineEfficiency {
  [1000, 10]: 0.65   // RPM=1000, Throttle=10%
  [1000, 50]: 0.85   // RPM=1000, Throttle=50%
  [3000, 10]: 0.70
  [3000, 50]: 0.90
}

flow FuelConsumption {
  from: FuelTank
  to: sink
  rate: Power / LOOKUP2D(RPM, Throttle, EngineEfficiency)
}
```

### Time-Based Patterns

Use `LOOKUP(TIME, pattern)` to create seasonal variations, policy changes, or scheduled events.

**Example: Seasonal Sales**
```
lookup SeasonalPattern {
  [0, 1.0]      // January: baseline
  [2, 0.9]      // March: 10% below
  [5, 1.3]      // June: 30% above
  [10, 1.5]     // November: 50% above (holidays)
  [11, 1.2]     // December: 20% above
  [12, 1.0]     // End of year
}

flow Sales {
  from: source
  to: Revenue
  rate: BaseSales * LOOKUP(TIME, SeasonalPattern)
}
```

### Termination Conditions

Stop simulation automatically when a condition is met.

**Syntax:**
```
terminate {
  when: boolean_expression
}
```

**Examples:**
```
terminate {
  when: Population <= 0
}

terminate {
  when: TIME >= 100
}

terminate {
  when: Inventory < 10 || BackOrder > 1000
}
```

### Graphs

Define custom visualizations for your model.

**Syntax:**
```
graph GraphName {
  title: "Display Title"
  variables: Var1, Var2, Var3
  type: line | area
  yAxisLabel: "Label"
  color: "#hexcolor"
}
```

**Examples:**
```
graph Overview {
  title: "System Overview"
  variables: Stock1, Stock2, Stock3
  type: line
  yAxisLabel: "Units"
}

graph Revenue {
  title: "Revenue Growth"
  variables: TotalRevenue
  type: area
  color: "#10b981"
}
```

### Tips and Best Practices

**Start Simple**
- Begin with basic stocks and flows
- Add complexity gradually
- Test each addition

**Use Meaningful Names**
- `Population` not `P`
- `BirthRate` not `BR`
- Names should explain what they represent

**Document with Comments**
- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Explain complex rate expressions
- Note assumptions and sources

**Choose Appropriate Delays**
- SMOOTH for information/perception delays
- DELAY for fixed pipeline delays
- DELAY_GRADUAL for biological/natural processes

**Test Edge Cases**
- What happens at zero?
- What if stocks hit min/max?
- Does termination work correctly?

**Use Lookup Tables for Nonlinearity**
- Real systems are rarely linear
- Lookup tables are more realistic than formulas
- Base points on data when possible

### Limitations

- Stock/flow names must be alphanumeric (plus underscore)
- Cannot define custom functions within DSL
- Expressions evaluate using JavaScript semantics
- History limited to last 1000 simulation points
- No string operations in rate expressions

## System Behavior

The default model demonstrates a classic "Limits to Growth" system archetype:
- Population grows exponentially (reinforcing loop)
- Resource consumption increases with population
- Resource stress increases mortality (balancing loop)
- Eventually resources deplete, limiting growth

## Next Steps

**Phase 2 Features (Planned):**
- Thermostat controls with thresholds and hysteresis
- Conditional flows that activate/deactivate based on system state
- Multi-stage control systems

**Phase 3 Features (Planned):**
- Cascading failure modeling for distributed systems
- Network topology visualization
- Load balancing and failure propagation

**Phase 4 Features (Planned):**
- Real-time behavior graphs (Recharts integration)
- Data export capabilities
- System health metrics dashboard

## Performance

- Load time: <2 seconds for basic models
- Simulation: 60fps during continuous animation
- Memory: Maintains last 1000 simulation points in history

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Mobile responsive design (tablets and phones)
