# Systems Thinking Tool Documentation

Welcome to the Systems Thinking Tool documentation! This comprehensive guide will help you master systems thinking and build dynamic models using our browser-based tool.

## üìö Documentation Overview

### [Getting Started Guide](getting-started-guide.md)
**Start here if you're new to systems thinking or the tool**

- What is systems thinking?
- Core concepts: stocks, flows, feedback loops
- Your first model walkthrough
- Understanding system behavior
- Common patterns and archetypes

Perfect for beginners who want to understand the fundamentals of systems thinking and how to use the tool effectively.

### [DSL Reference Guide](dsl-reference-guide.md)
**Complete syntax reference for the modeling language**

- Stock and flow syntax
- Rate expressions and operators
- Mathematical functions
- Delay functions (SMOOTH, DELAY, DELAY_GRADUAL)
- Lookup tables (1D and 2D)
- Termination conditions
- Graph definitions
- Complete working examples

Use this as your reference when building models. It covers every feature of the DSL with detailed examples.

### [AI Development Guide](ai-development-guide.md)
**Leverage AI to help you build and refine models**

- How to use Claude for model development
- Effective prompting strategies
- Common model patterns
- Debugging with AI assistance
- Best practices for AI-assisted modeling

Learn how to work with AI tools to rapidly prototype and iterate on your system models.

### [Claude Skill File](../SKILL.md)
**Load this file into Claude for optimal AI assistance**

This file contains specialized instructions that help Claude understand the Systems Thinking Tool and provide better assistance. Simply upload this file to Claude before asking for help with your models.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **New to systems thinking?** ‚Üí Start with the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started-guide.md)
2. **Ready to build?** ‚Üí Use the [DSL Reference](dsl-reference-guide.md)
3. **Want AI help?** ‚Üí Check out the [AI Development Guide](ai-development-guide.md)

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### Learning Systems Thinking
The Getting Started Guide provides a solid foundation in systems thinking concepts with interactive examples you can run in the tool.

### Building Models
The DSL Reference is your go-to resource for syntax and features. All examples are copy-paste ready.

### Working with AI
The AI Development Guide shows you how to effectively collaborate with Claude to build, debug, and refine your models.

## üí° Tips for Success

**Start Simple**
- Begin with basic stock-and-flow models
- Add complexity gradually
- Test each addition before moving forward

**Use the Examples**
- All documentation includes working examples
- Copy and modify examples to learn faster
- Study the default model in the tool

**Leverage AI**
- Upload the SKILL.md file to Claude
- Ask Claude to explain model behavior
- Use AI to help debug issues

**Experiment and Iterate**
- Systems thinking is learned by doing
- Try variations of your models
- Observe how changes affect behavior
